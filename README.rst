What it is?
===========

Websauna gives you building blocks for creating scalable, state-of-the-art websites and services. The framework enables  efficient business problem solving, so that developers can maximize productivity from day zero. Websauna is suggestive and has default options on all parts of stack, so one can follow a red line to get the first release out quickly. On the other hand, Websauna does not enforce hard opinions and sacrifice flexibility, so that experienced developers can easily override parts and use more sophisticated components for specific needs.

How it is done?
===============

Websauna achieves flexibility by keeping its own codebase minimal and not reinventing the wheel. Instead it provides a polished integration of the top packages of Python ecosystem like Pyramid web framework, SQLAlchemy object relationship mapper, Alembic migration scripts, IPython shell, Authomatic federated login, Jinja templating and py.test testing framework.

When to use it?
===============

Websauna is focused on Internet facing sites where you have a public or private sign up process and administrative backend. It's sweet spots are custom business portals, software-as-a-service sites and consumer portals where out of the box software cannot satisfy your needs and you need to program moderate amount of business logic. A special focus is given for security, so that Websauna is a strong candidate for financial technology and eCommerce solutions.
