Welcome to Websauna, a Python web application framework for building consumer and community websites.

Websauna is a "macro" Python framework for building websites up to 50M users. Its goal is to provide all the basic building elements of a site, from log in and sign up process, so developers can focus solving business application problems instead of dealing with issues common for all web applications. When you install Websauna, you have a fully functional website where you can start add in your custom functionality.

To achieve this, Websauna provides a set of basic building blocks which form a fully functional site out of the box. All of the building blocks are interchangeable, so when your business gets more traction and more sophisticated solutions are needed, you have an upgraed path of replacing Websauna components with more scalable ones.
