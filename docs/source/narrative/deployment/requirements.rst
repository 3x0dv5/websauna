Requirements
============

To run a Websauna application you need a server with

* 1 CPU

* 1 GB RAM

* Root access

* Linux (currently Microsoft Windows installations are possible, but untested)

It is possible to run Websauna on a shared hosting, but due to an increased complexity set it up it is not covered here.

.. note ::

    It is possible to run Websauna with 512 MB or less RAM, but there are practical deployment problems e.g due to GCC compiler memory usage.
