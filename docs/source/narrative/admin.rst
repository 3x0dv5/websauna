Admin
=====

Admin, the short for "administration interface", is user experience to easily manage your data in Websauna. Admin interface should do the heavy lifting for writing a lot of CRUD forms for managing your application data.

The default Websauna admin interface

* is accessible only by users who belong to the site managers - they have been given administration permission through groups

* registers SQLAlchemy models and has CRUD forms automatically generated form them
